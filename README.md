Custom code for STM32F103T8 to create a small low-power control device that allws frame-based control of SPI leds (like WS2812, SK6812 and so on) and servos at the same time. 
Project features parallel control of different elements, multiple device syncronisation via UART protocol, and human-readable instructions file in a g-code style.

Project is written using CooCox
There are some modules derived from several libraries, but heavily refactored with spped and program size optimisation in mind
